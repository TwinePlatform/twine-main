A user data-collection service for [Power to Change](http://www.powertochange.org.uk/)'s [Twine](http://www.twine-together.com/) platform. See it in action at [datapower.herokuapp.com](https://datapower.herokuapp.com).

## The challenge
Power to Change works with community businesses across the UK. Their clients wanted a way to find out which of their services were most popular, and whether this changed over different demographic groups.

The community business owners themselves did not always have time to check who was attending which activities. It was also important that the process of customers sharing information was confidential and quick.

## What Datapower does
When a user registers with the site, Datapower gives them a QR code (which can be downloaded, printed or photographed) to identify them.

On subsequent visits to the community business, the user can quickly sign in with their QR code (accessed through a webcam), then select a chosen activity from a list of options. Their user information and activity selected is then saved on the database.

The local business owners will then be able to retrieve information about the popularity of their different offers, and whether this changes according to demographic groups. This can help them tailor their services to the needs and preferences of their local community.
