1. [Credentials](#credentials)

## Which Application?
There are several hosted versions of the application in different environments. For those user testing the application, only two are significant:
* the production application - https://visitor.twine-together.com
* the beta application - https://visitor-beta.twine-together.com

Both applications are running against the production API, so should present and manipulate the same data.

## Credentials
Since both applications are running against the same API, the same credentials may be used to sign into either. Look in the team credentials-store (currently LastPass) for "Visitor app demo account"

## User Testing
User testing questions for user testing the production app can currently be found in [this issue](https://github.com/TwinePlatform/hq/issues/55), but will be documented here in future.

User testing questions for the beta app can currently be found in [this issue](https://github.com/TwinePlatform/twine-visitor/issues/670), but will be documented here in future.
