IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE<br/><br/>23.1. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.<br/><br/>24. EVEN IF WE DELAY IN ENFORCING THIS CONTRACT, WE CAN STILL ENFORCE IT LATER<br/><br/>24.1. Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.<br/><br/>25. WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT AND WHERE YOU MAY BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS<br/><br/>25.1. These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts.

We hope you are satisfied with the App, but if you wish to raise any complaint, please contact us on powertochangeTwine@gmail.com], and we will try to resolve your issue promptly. If you are not happy with how we handle your complaint, you may want to submit a complaint to the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR), who are an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, via www.cedr.com (please note CEDR may charge you). ADR is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of ADR, you can still bring legal proceedings.
