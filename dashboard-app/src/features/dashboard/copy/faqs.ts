      'The dashboard features easy read charts of your data, which can be filtered for added clarity. Use the legend to the right of the chart to select the data you do and don’t want to see. Simply click on any label within the legend to show or remove that data from the chart. Selecting ‘All’ will either select or deselect all the data. Hover your cursor over the chart to find out more information about the chart, explained in a pop-up box called a ‘tooltip’.',

You can also toggle the data between hours and days, giving you both detailed and higher level insight into volunteering activity at your organisation.

For example, you may have a project which requires volunteers to lead ‘grow your own veg’ sessions in a community garden. You may also have volunteers involved in building a new learning centre in the garden. ‘Project’ enables you to distinguish between these outdoor activities. In this example, you could create a project called ‘Grow your own’ and another project called ‘Learning centre’. Volunteers can then code their activity (outdoor and practical work) to these respective projects, helping you understand which projects require the most time and effort, as well as report to your Board and relevant funders if necessary.',
